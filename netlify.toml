# Netlify build configuration for static site
#
# This configuration copies static files to a 'build' directory during deployment.
# The build directory is created automatically by the build command.
#
# IMPORTANT: In Netlify UI (Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings):
# - Build command: Can be left empty (uses netlify.toml) or should match below
# - Publish directory: Should be set to "build" or left empty (uses netlify.toml)
