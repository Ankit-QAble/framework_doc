# Netlify build configuration for static site

# IMPORTANT: Make sure in Netlify UI (Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings):
# - Build command: Leave empty or set to: echo 'Static site - no build required'
# - Publish directory: Leave empty or set to: . (root directory)
# The netlify.toml file should override UI settings, but verify both match.
